I have graduated from LUMS with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am working as an Analyst Engineer (Team Lead) at Quantum Intelligence. In my current role, I am working on cutting edge machine learning & deep learning problems. These days I am working on Optical Character Recognition System for Urdu names using Deep Neural Networks and also overseeing a team of 6 people.

Over the last year, I have acquired all the necessary skills required from a Machine Learning Engineer. I have developed the skills by learning from online courses and by doing projects on my own. I am proficient in Python and I have a deep understanding of all the major machine learning techniques and algorithms.

Key Technologies and Methodologies:
-Machine Learning
-Deep Learning
-Computer Vision
-Natural Language Processing
-Python
-SQL
-PyTorch
